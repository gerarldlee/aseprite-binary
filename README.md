# aseprite-binary
An aseprite binary build for Windows x64

# description
This is a binary build taken from https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite which is open source.  This is more of like a convenience way to get the sources working.  This is built using Windows 10 x64 with MS-Visual Studio 15 community edition.

I have build aseprite using both libraries - Allegro and Skia.  My personal opinions were Allegro are faster, seamless and seems to operate better than the Skia build.  However as noted by the developer of aseprite, Allegro will be faced out soon and Skia is a newwer graphics library that have been used in Google Chrome / Chromium browser.  So from the developers point of view, moving forward, Skia is better to use.  However, if your an artist or a game designer, which is why this binary build exists for you guys who doesnt want to dwell on the building part of it.

If you found you are earning with this project, you may want to give back to David Capello, the author of aseprite at https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite

# running

Just get the allegro, or skia folder, run the aseprite.exe, then youre good to go!

Cheers!
